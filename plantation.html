<p>The seeds arrived today! They came in a lumpy, beige envelope with customs labels attached from GH (Ghana). I opened the envelope and withdrew two pale green exportation certificates with iridescent seals of authenticity. The documents were flecked with yellow grease transferred from a brown paper bag. The bag's label read 'JIBRIL ENTERPRISE'. There's a Ghana address, GPS coordinates and Yahoo email contact (to ensure customer satisfaction, I imagine). The Latin species name is printed in italics: <i>'Elaeis guineensis'</i>, more commonly known as African oil palm.</p>
<p>As I dip my hand into the paper bag to fish for the seeds, I imagine a warm humid climate. I google the weather in Kumasi in south-central Ghana. It's full sunshine. 30°C. I discover that the tropical region receives an average of 1,400mm of rain per year. London's average is 580mm. I make a mental note to investigate oil palm's cultivation details and phone my brother-in-law who works in a plant nursery.</p>

<p>The seeds are the size of large marbles but are shaped like pears of varying proportions. A hairy blonde grain runs from base to tip, striating the amber-ebony pericarp. The grain concentrates at a point; is this where they open? I observe individual specimens through a jeweller's loupe. The surface comprises a web of filaments, which I hadn't noticed before, criss-crossing the entire body. Nexuses of these filaments seem to be gummed down by waxy secretions. I count 50 seeds in total.</p>

<p>Today I visited the plant nursery. I spoke with the manager, an experienced horticulturalist, about cultivating my oil palm seeds. He first asked whether the plant was 'at risk' and whether it was known to carry any viruses. There are official lists, he said. I thought back to the exportation certificates that accompanied the paper bag of seeds. <i>Even in its early stages, this project has exposed a range of practices for managing life. The oil palm, the yeast, and the algae are all biological specimens subject to different regulations or 'biopolicies'.</i></p>
<p>The horticulturalist and I spoke at length about the conditions that the seeds would require and the duration of each growth phase. This kind of knowledge is hard to sift for online; there doesn't seem to be a straightforward protocol for growing oil palm from seeds in a non-tropical climate. The horticulturalist had never grown oil palm before. But he shared some advice based on tacit practices for other tropical plants.</p>
<p>First, the temperatures in the greenhouse where I thought to grow the plants would be too variable. These greenhouses are the size of football pitches, so you can imagine that the atmosphere is hard to control completely. Instead, I could try using a heated propagator on my windowsill at home. In this case, I would place the seeds between two layers of damp blotting paper. Hopefully, after three months or so, I would be able to pot the sprouted seeds and keep them in an incubator.</p>

<p>Back at my desk, I researched DIY propagators. Rather than purchasing a ready-made, I wanted to build the propagator myself in order to learn more about the material processes that create the (artificial) conditions for life. <i>Gaining firsthand experience, getting 'oily palms', is what this project is all about.</i> To make a propagator from scratch, I would need to procure a thermostatic heat mat, which I could layer with recycled insulation and sand. This bed would be housed in a wooden frame with clear plastic panelling.</p>
<p>Here are some insights and ideas to keep in mind for cultivating oil palm in the UK and documenting its growth.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leave some seeds unsprouted, to show the whole growth process.</li>
  <li>Grow the oil palm in batches at staggered times for the same reason.</li>
  <li>Make sure you check <b>which way up</b> to plant the seeds when the time comes!</li>
  <li>And check how deep the roots grow.</li>
  <li>You could network with experts at ornamental glasshouses like Kew or the Eden Project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, when the plants are more mature, here are some key cultivation details.<p>
<ul>
  <li>A daytime temperature of 20-35°C is optimal.</li>
  <li>An adequate water supply is essential.</li>
  <li>Oil palm requires a humus-rich soil with a pH range of 4.5-6.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming full circle, I've been contemplating the oceans of biomass left after growing oil palms. Plantation is an entire system of growth and afterlife. Palm oil is derived from the mesocarp, the fleshy middle layer of the fruit. The rest of the plant has to go somewhere. Oil palm biomass can include empty fruit bunches, mesocarp fibres, kernel shells, fronds, trunks, and any effluent from the mill. <a href="./palm-oil.html">Palm oil</a> itself is often referred to as problematic. But it is the whole <i>system</i> of ecological relations that need taking into account. Biorefineries might help reduce or reuse biomass, perhaps converting the former waste into mulch, fertiliser, or biofuel. For more on biorefineries in general, see the <a href="./algae.html">'Algae'</a> thread of this diary.</p>

<p>In my previous diary entry, I wrote about biomass as one aspect of plantation systems. Another way of understanding palm oil systematically is as an economic commodity. Palm oil is a 'cash crop' like coffee, cocoa, sugar, vegetables, peanuts, tobacco, and cotton. The <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/gemet-environmental-thesaurus/cash-crop" target="_blank">European Environment Agency (EEA)</a> provide the following definition for cash crops. I've emboldened a few key phrases.</p>
<blockquote>Crops that are grown for sale in the town markets or for export. [...] Huge areas of countries in the developing world have been turned over to cash crops. Those countries with no mineral or oil resources <b>depend on cash crops for foreign money</b> [...]. However, critics argue that cash crops are planted on <b>land that would otherwise be used to grow food for the local community</b> and say this is a cause of <b>world famine</b>. [...] Moreover, if the best agricultural land is used for cash crops, local farmers are <b>forced to use marginal land to grow food for local consumption</b>, and this has a further dramatic effect on the <b>environment</b>.</blockquote>
<p>The above definition of 'cash crop' highlights the postcolonial inequities of globalised agriculture.
There is also the impact of climate change to take into account. Places that rely on cash crops are often those with climates most impacted by climate change. Imagine depending on the cash crop harvest, then facing an unprecedented drought.</p>

<p>The matter of cash crops throws up competing themes of replication and singularity. On the one hand, repetition is central to cash crop systems. Cash crops are defined by repeating patterns. Oil palm originated on the African continent but plantations are being replicated across the humid tropics, especially Southeast Asia. On the other hand, the system is vulnerable to singular events, such as extreme weather, political upheavals, or plant diseases. Each individual plant is also has a unique DNA expression, a unique number of fruits.</p>
<p>I began thinking about replication and singularity while printmaking with artificial palm leaves. I started with monoprints. 'Mono' means 'one'. So a monoprint is a unique print, one of a kind. You can use your inked design first for a full colour print, then again for a faded 'ghost print'. Aside from digitising the artwork, there is no way to replicate the print in exactly the same way. Other printmaking techniques, such as etching or woodblock, focus on producing a repeatable pattern. Then there is also the way that you display prints; works could be part of a series perhaps in a grid formation on the wall, balancing the uniqueness of each print, which captures a moment in time, with the repetition of using the same pattern over and over again.</p>

<h4 class="definition">plantation</h4>
  <blockquote>A farming unit for the production of one of the staple crops in the southern colonies of North America and the British West Indies. Plantation farming may also refer to any tropical crops grown elsewhere, such as rubber, beverage crops, sisal, and oil palm. [...] Following the abolition of slavery most plantations were divided into small farms but some continue to be worked by low-paid labourers.<br><br>– <i>A Dictionary of World History (ed. Wright, 2015).</i></blockquote>
