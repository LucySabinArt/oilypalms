    <p>A small, white box, its interior padded with foam, contains a glass vial with a silver screw top. The yeast strain manifests in the form of small dots on the surface of the agar inside the vial. This is strain no. 747 from the National Collection of Yeast Cultures (NCYC) based at the Quadram Institute Bioscience in Norwich. It's a type of yeast called <i>Metschnikowia pulcherrima.</i></p>
<p>Found on grapes, cherries, flowers, and spoiled fruit, M. pulcherrima is carried by fruit flies and used in vinification. The yeast is also being considered as an alternative to palm oil and as a biofuel. M. pulcherrima will grow in a wide range of conditions, which is partly thanks to its antimicrobial properties. At the same time, the yeast has a low space-time yield in comparison with palm oil.</p>
<p>I search online for scientific papers that might outline how to cultivate this yeast. I find an article by researchers at the University of Bath entitled, 'Achieving a high-density oleaginous yeast culture: Comparison of four processing strategies using Metschnikowia pulcherrima' (Abeln and Chuck, 2019). The authors use terms like 'microbial lipid', 'reaction rates', 'fermentation modes', 'commercialization', 'high cell density', and 'concentrated feed solution'.</p>
<p>A phrase jumps off the webpage: 'extreme conditions'. Extreme conditions are, according to the researchers, 'necessary for economic lipid production'. I wonder if I can really expect to replicate the conditions that M. pulcherrima needs to produce oils at home, extreme or not. Some further research and additional equipment are needed. In the meantime, I can store the yeast in my fridge.</p>

<p>The yeast remains in my fridge; I still have no sterile loops for transferring some of the culture into petri dishes. I faced a similar problem with the algae, which I poured into filtered water with a few drops of plant food, instead of the recommended nutrient solution. My lack of basic biology resources has led to improvisation as well as a realisation about the importance of conditions.</p>
<p>In caring for M. pulcherrima and A. protothecoides, I must confront the conditions that scientists aim to meticulously establish in their laboratories. These conditions are being systematically optimised for each organism, with the objective of producing as much palm oil substitute as possible. The life form represents just one element of these experiments: the mutable and generative independent variable.</p>
 <p>Unlike the scientists, I am not equipped with the necessary knowledge and resources to make oils from microbial machines, hence the yeast still lying dormant in my fridge. Fortunately, I am more interested in the <i>experience</i> of experimentation, rather than the results. The biological engineers are striving to produce scalable substitutes for palm oil. I am focussing on the meanings and feelings beyond scientific language. And I must report a creeping sense of guilt that, in my unpreparedness, I have failed my specimens by not providing optimal, artificial environments in which they can continue to grow.</p>
