    <p>Today, I pushed the yeast, algae and seeds aside to focus instead on the materiality of palm oil itself. For research purposes, I procured a bottle of MP NAIJA PALM OIL from a major supermarket. The product comes in a one-litre plastic bottle
      with an orange lid. There is a photo of an oil palm bunch of ripened fruits on the green label. The nutritional information per 100g is presented in a chart (Fat | 99g). In several languages (GB, F, ES, IT, G), the contents are described as
      follows.</p>
    <blockquote>Palm Oil is used for soups, fries and traditional African cuisine. INGREDIENTS: Palm Oil. Produce of West Africa. CAUTION: Do not heat above 200°C.</blockquote>

    <p>Palm oil is liquid at room temperature (on a warm day in September), so it has already melted. What would happen at 200°C? Would the oil start to vaporise? At the other end of the spectrum, what happens when palm oil is refrigerated or frozen?
      I suppose it becomes like butter and ice. The consistency changes based on climate, so direct experiences of palm oil would vary the world over, without temperature control that is.</p>

    <p>I unscrewed the bottle top and raised the opening to my nose. How to describe that faint smell? Is it earthy? Woodsy? Maybe I could extract and concentrate the fragrance somehow. I'm surprised the oil even smells at all, given that one of its
      commercially desirable qualities is its tastelessness.
    </p>
    <p>I pour a little oil into a glass jar. A drop or two gets on my fingers, tinting my skin yellow until I rub it in, and the oil disappears. The colour is remarkable: a deep rusty red with golden legs. Yellow ochre coats the insides of my glass
      jar as I tilt it this way and that. There are some fragments of pulp at the bottom of the bottle. I presume this to be the flesh of the fruit.</p>
    <p><i>These traces of palm oil are revelations. Like many others in 'Western' societies, my body has unknowingly contacted and ingested this substance in foods and beauty products at various points throughout my life. Usually palm oil is blended
        and hidden within another form. Now, it is tangible.</i></p>

    <p>I try making marks on paper with palm oil. The yellow grease stains through each sheet to the other side. I start to scrawl meandering sentences around these oily marks, writing in an 'oily' way. "What else cold I use palm oil for?", I
      scribble in spiralling script. If it stains paper, perhaps the oil could stain and finish wood too. Perhaps the oil could be used for marbling...</p>

    <p>Marbling is a surface design technique that originated in Japan, before travelling across Central Asia, and into Europe. Pigments are floated on water or a solution thickened with powdered seaweed. Patterns can be generated through moving the
      liquid in the bath. Prints capture patterns at fixed points in time when paper, for example, contacts the surface of the water and picks up the colour.</p>

    <p>I recently attended a marbling workshop with a local artist, <a href="https://mindfulmarbling.com/" target="_blank">Lisa Ibbetson.</a> She teaches suminagashi, Japanese ink marbling. Lisa explained how the technique is an unique encounter with
      the surface of water. Rather than completely controlling the process, the marbler is an observer or participant. Wielding brushes, surfactant, needles, vodka, straws, and fans, we played with the fluid dynamics of ink on water and admired the
      effects.</p>
    <p>We talked about palm oil during the marbling workshop. We talked about the oily qualities of the inks. Lisa confirmed that you can use oils for marbling. The only downside is that they grease up brushes and water trays. I'm prepared to take
      that risk. I like the idea that marbling could set in motion the dynamics of palm oil, as a material collaboration. Poignantly, some of our more intricate marbled prints looked like aerial photographs of landscapes devastated by slash and burn.
    </p>
    <p>Later that day, I explored another technique for sensorially engaging with palm oil: I added a few drops of the oil to a 'Slime' mixture. Slime is a craze in children's toys. It can be made with household ingredients such as glue and washing
      up liquid. Innovative recipes are shared across the internet. I stirred the oil into the slime, then kneaded and stretched the gloopy ball. Slime is tactile in a satisfying way. It is an ideal medium for smelling and touching palm oil.
      Afterwards, the smell of palm oil lingered on my palms.</p>
